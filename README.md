# Body-Vitals-Monitoring-System
We have used MAX30105 Particle sensor to monitor body vitals like ventricular rate, body temperature and SPO2 through Photoplethysmography (PPG). This project aims at warning individuals whenever that heartrate exceeds the maximum heart rate that a person can have. We take age of the user as input in the web application for this purpose. We calculate Maximum Heart Rate allowed for that age and warn if the current heart rate exceeds that as that can cause tear in muscles of heart. We also calculate peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (spo2) of the person using the same PPG methodology. We calibrate body temperature and provide appropriate suggestions based on its value. We also monitor the current zone of the heart. We also indicate the heart rate zone of the person whose heart rate is being monitored and predict the current physical activity of that person based on this. We also warn individuals with Tachycardia to meet a doctor.
